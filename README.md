# Loan Eligibility Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict loan eligibility based on customer information. It leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to preprocess data, analyze patterns, and train a predictive model. This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the workflow for solving the problem.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to build a model that can predict whether an applicant is eligible for a loan based on factors such as income, loan amount, credit history, and more. The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset into the workspace.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualization and statistical summaries.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming data to prepare it for modeling.
4. **Model Building**: Training a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## File Structure
- `Loan_eligibility.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the project.
- `data/`: Directory (not included in the repository) where the dataset should be placed. Replace this path with the actual dataset path during execution.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-eligibility-prediction.git
   cd loan-eligibility-prediction
   ```

2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Loan_eligibility.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the notebook's instructions to execute the analysis and modeling steps.

## Results
The notebook concludes with the performance evaluation of the model, including accuracy and other relevant metrics. It also includes visualizations that summarize key findings during the EDA phase.
